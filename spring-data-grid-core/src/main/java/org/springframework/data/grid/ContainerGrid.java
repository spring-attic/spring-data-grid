/**
 * Container grid allows to track members in a grid. Contract for
 * interacting with user depends on the actual implementation which
 * can be either build-in discovery system or static without any
 * discovery logic.
 * <p>
 * If implementation has build-in discovery a use of setter methods outside
 * of the implementation should be discouraged. Although it is up to
 * the implementation what is actually supported.
 * <p>
 * Implementation can also be static in terms of that there are
 * no logic for discovery and in case of that user is responsible
 * to feed data into the implementation. In case of that the implementation
 * would only have structure to store the necessary information.
 * This is useful in cases where access to grid system needs to be abstracted
 * still keeping the grid logic in its own implementation.
 * <p>
 * This interface and its extended interfaces are strongly typed
 * order to allow extending returned types (i.e. {@link ContainerNode}
 * to suit the needs of a custom implementations.
